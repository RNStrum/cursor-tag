# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Context
- **Starting commit:** c0aebc0 Initial commit
- **Current step:** App initialization (Step 1: Requirements Gathering)
- **Status:** In progress

## Current Task: Application Initialization
Working through the project:init-app command to help user set up their new application from this template.

### App Requirements: 2D Online Tag Game
**Core Concept:** Two-player online tag game where players control circles with mouse movement
- **"It" player:** Starts at random edge position, tries to catch runner
- **Runner player:** Starts in center, tries to avoid being caught
- **Game area:** Circular boundary constraining movement
- **Win condition:** Game ends when "it" touches runner
- **Features:** Real-time multiplayer, timer, collision detection

### Progress:
- ✅ Created initialization todos
- ✅ Starting claude-notes.md documentation
- ✅ Gathered requirements from user

### MVP Implementation Plan:
1. ✅ Set up Convex schema for games and players  
2. Create game canvas with basic circle rendering
3. Implement mouse movement and boundary constraints
4. Add collision detection
5. Build multiplayer synchronization
6. Add timer and game flow
7. Polish UX and responsive design

### Current Status: MVP implementation complete and tested

### Session Commits:
- f2f9cfb: init: document 2D tag game requirements and remove template instructions
- eaa3184: feat: implement core 2D tag game with Convex backend, game canvas, and multiplayer lobby
- 4e5c8e4: test: verify servers running and authentication working, update implementation notes
- 220687f: fix: remove authentication requirement and optimize performance with throttled updates
- d079b36: fix: improve multiplayer join with real-time updates and better player state tracking
- e145371: perf: optimize gameplay performance by reducing update frequency and unnecessary database calls
- 7270569: fix: resolve variable name conflict in GameCanvas causing compilation error

### Implementation Summary:
✅ **Backend (Convex):**
- Game and player schema with real-time sync
- Functions: createGame, joinGame, updatePosition, getGame, getMyGames
- Collision detection and win condition logic
- Position boundary constraints

✅ **Frontend (React):**
- GameCanvas component with HTML5 Canvas rendering
- Mouse-controlled player movement
- Real-time multiplayer synchronization
- Game lobby with create/join functionality
- Timer display and game state management

✅ **Features Implemented:**
- Circular play area with boundary constraints
- Runner starts in center, "It" starts at random edge
- Real-time position updates
- Collision detection for game end
- Timer and game flow management
- Responsive UI with DaisyUI styling

### Testing Status:
- Development servers launched successfully
- Frontend loading correctly at localhost:5173
- ✅ Authentication removed - no sign-in required
- ✅ Performance optimized with 60 FPS throttling
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Ready for user testing

### Recent Fixes Applied:
1. **Removed Authentication Requirement:**
   - Games now work without Clerk sign-in
   - Anonymous users with auto-generated IDs
   - Optional player name input
   - Simplified game joining flow

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Throttled position updates to 60 FPS (16ms)
   - Reduced database calls
   - Smoother mouse movement
   - Better real-time synchronization

3. **Multiplayer Join Fix:**
   - Added real-time query updates (100ms refetch interval)
   - Improved player state tracking and validation
   - Fixed join form visibility logic
   - Better handling of game state transitions from "waiting" to "playing"

4. **Performance Optimization (Latest):**
   - Reduced query refetch interval from 100ms to 1 second
   - Increased mouse update throttle from 16ms to 50ms (60 FPS → 20 FPS)
   - Added position change detection (only update DB if moved >5 pixels)
   - Significantly reduced unnecessary database calls

## Important Notes:
- Template includes: React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend), Convex (backend), Clerk (auth)
- If starting from fresh session, reread project:init-app command file for context
- User should describe their app idea clearly before proceeding to implementation
