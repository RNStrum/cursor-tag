# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Context
- **Starting commit:** c0aebc0 Initial commit
- **Current step:** App initialization (Step 1: Requirements Gathering)
- **Status:** In progress

## Current Task: Application Initialization
Working through the project:init-app command to help user set up their new application from this template.

### App Requirements: 2D Online Tag Game
**Core Concept:** Two-player online tag game where players control circles with mouse movement
- **"It" player:** Starts at random edge position, tries to catch runner
- **Runner player:** Starts in center, tries to avoid being caught
- **Game area:** Circular boundary constraining movement
- **Win condition:** Game ends when "it" touches runner
- **Features:** Real-time multiplayer, timer, collision detection

### Progress:
- ✅ Created initialization todos
- ✅ Starting claude-notes.md documentation
- ✅ Gathered requirements from user

### Next Steps:
1. Document responses and remove template instructions from CLAUDE.md
2. Plan and implement MVP

## Important Notes:
- Template includes: React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend), Convex (backend), Clerk (auth)
- If starting from fresh session, reread project:init-app command file for context
- User should describe their app idea clearly before proceeding to implementation

## Session Commits:
- (Will be updated as we make progress)
